        <h2>What Does Food Scarcity Mean?</h2>
        <p>
          According to the USDA, food insecurity is defined as a 
          "household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food." 
          Households that are unable to go out to obtain healthy and fresh food every single day are considered to be food insecure. 
          The reason for this could be due to a multitude of factors such as having insufficient money, no reliable form of transportation, 
          or being stuck in a food desert. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Food insecurity affects millions across the United States, including children, seniors, and vulnerable populations. 
          It is also usually associated with income, and about one-third of households below the official poverty line are food insecure, 
          according to Nebraska legislation. In addition, it is strongly linked to other factors such as education, housing status, 
          and sudden income changes. Understanding its causes and impacts is essential for addressing this issue.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Food Deserts In Depth</h2>
        <p>
          What are food deserts? The Food, Energy, and Conservation Act of 2008 defines food deserts as 
          "areas in the United States with limited access to affordable and nutritious food, particularly such an area composed of predominantly 
          lower-income neighborhoods and communities." 
        </p>
        <p>
          They are a major public health issue, affecting both urban and rural areas. In Andrew Thierolf's thesis on the Nebraska Sandhills Food Desert, 
          he discusses how this area faces unique challenges due to extremely low population density, economic constraints, 
          and a declining grocery store presence. 
          Other states have implemented programs to fight food deserts in the past, so what are the solutions? Thierolf lets readers know that 
          federal programs alone are not enough. Nebraska needs statewide initiatives and legislation to create change. All in all, addressing food deserts 
          will require long-term government commitment and planning to shape the future of the Sandhills as well as rural Nebraska.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Additional Statistics</h2>
        <p>
          Food insecurity raises healthcare costs and reduces economic productivity. According to the US Census Bureau, in 2019, 
          56.4% of people in Omaha, Nebraska, reported having low access to healthy food. 
          Additionally, according to the Nebraska Legislature, in 2016 food insecurity added $258 million in healthcare costs in Nebraska. 
          In 2018, 12.3% of Nebraska's population was food insecure. In perspective, that is roughly 237,440 people, of which 16.7% (79,310) were children 
          and 4.4% were seniors. Unfortunately, smaller counties like Thurston have higher rates of food insecurity, highlighting regional inequality. 
          Although it is easy to see food scarcity as a distant issue, the problem is much closer than it may seem.

        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          While it may seem all bad, government bodies, officials, and even you can start to take action. 
          The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is currently the largest government-sponsored food assistance program, 
          and officials are looking into ways to improve access and increase benefits to provide better food security. 
          There have also been enhanced participation rates in programs like the School Breakfast Program (SBP) that promote awareness 
          and provide free or reduced-price meals. 
          Of course, there are also general improvements that can be made, such as state and local policy, enhanced economic opportunities, 
          building awareness, and improving access in rural areas to name a few. 
          Finally, supporting local charitable food systems helps to support individuals who may not qualify for federal assistance 
          and address the increased demand for charitable food resources.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Food deserts make it difficult for households in Nebraska to lead healthy lifestyles and have healthy outcomes. When mapping food deserts,
          they are assigned based on whether residents in a certain geographic area can access healthy and affordable foods. According to a 
          research analysis by Gregory J. McKee and Shawn C. Kaskie on food deserts in Nebraska, healthy food is considered to be inaccessible when "at 
          least 33% of the population in a region resides more than 10 miles from the nearest supermarket." It also helps to understand that healthy food
          is considered unaffordable when "over 20% of the population in a Census tract is classified as below the poverty rate or when the median family income 
          in the tract is less than 80% of the state median." Knowing this, take a look at the map above. In the map above from the Nebraska 
          Legislature, we see a map of Counties in Nebraska in 2016 that met the USDA definition for being considered a food desert highlighted in dark green.  
        </p>

        <p>Maps like this are useful when identifying the issue of food scarcity and help us to understand the causes as well as different factors that may 
          impact how widespread the issue is. They also help us to understand how the issue has persisted and changed over time. Below, we will take a look 
          at different maps in Nebraska which may give us a better understanding of this issue and how it relates to other factors such as education, income, and poverty.

        <p>In this first map, we can see food deserts in Nebraska using more recent data gathered from such as the CFRA (2023), UNL BFBL (2022), and ESRI (2024)
          as described by McKee and Kaskie in their research. The map highlights areas that have access to grocery stores as well as farmers market locations using green
          and purple respectively as pictured in the legend. The pink-highlighted counties are the ones that meet the USDA's definition of being a food desert. It is 
          interesting to compare this data to the map given by the Nebraska Legislature to see that the problem is being addressed and that we are making great progress. Our work is not 
          done but it is nice to see that legislation, policy change, and taking action has made a positive impact in Nebraska since 2016. </p>

        <p>Though we are making progress, the world is constantly changing. Based on projected net worth data in 2028 (ESRI), regions where the average net worth per capita is less than that 
          $1,000,000 qualifies as areas where healthy food may be unaffordable. Typically, at this net worth level, residents are more likely to liquidate assets to purchase food rather than
          invest in food retail businesses. Combined with the USDA Low Income and Low Access criteria, we are given the projected food deserts including Census tracts in pink and Zip code
          regions in tan/brown fade. With this information, it is clear that we must continue to address this issue, or we will continue to see growth in food deserts in rural Nebraska.

        <p>Taking a look at this map, we can see a direct relationship between food deserts and population density. It follows that areas with a larger population typically do not
          have food scarcity issues while more scarce regions do see a lot more problems. This could be attributed to many factors such as financial risk for food distribution businesses
          as well as not enough demand for businesses to want to open locations in these areas. The unfortunate reality is that though many of these areas could use more grocery stores, 
          businesses do not have a profitable reason to open stores for these people.

        <p>Although the education of a population is not by any means the only determining factor for whether a region is food-scarce, it is interesting to see the relationship between
          education and food scarcity. There are many outliers but we do see that the general trend is that more educated areas typically see less food deserts. Whether this be due to 
          the education itself or other factors such as greater population size and higher income, nonetheless, it is interesting to analyze these results compared to the previous maps. </p>

        <p>Another unsurprising but important map takes a look at disposable income in Nebraska. Again, we see the general trend that areas with less disposable income are more prone to being stuck
          in food deserts. The findings from this map support what we have concluded previously about the relationship between income and food scarcity, and there is no real surprise 
          in the results of this map. </p>

        <p>While income is undoubtedly an important factor when it comes to whether or not households are food-scarce, sudden changes in employment can potentially impact their ability to 
          purchase food. Areas that have higher rates of unemployment can increase their spending if employment increases, but employment opportunities in smaller counties are far and few between. 
          According to McKee and Kaskie, in 2023, "Nebraska counties with a food desert designation had lower unemployment than counties without food desert designations." Unfortunately, 
          with more employment opportunities in areas with a larger population, and subsequently better food access, many of the unemployed population in smaller regions may migrate away.

        <p>Surprisingly, food desert regions have lower poverty rates than those without food desert designations. This could be due to a multitude of reasons but  
          residents living in poverty may be leaving food desert counties. Low-population counties like Cherry and Grant showed extremely variable poverty levels. On the other hand,
          higher-population counties like Lincoln and Dawson have a larger percentage of the population living in poverty. These findings could support the fact that food scarcity is 
          more heavily tied to the size of a population rather than its poverty rates.

        <h2>Effects On Children</h2>
        <p>Food insecurity impacts mental, physical, and social development with long-term consequences for future well-being. According to the Nebraska Legislature, children who experience 
          food insecurity are 2-4 times as likely to develop health problems as opposed to children who do not. It has also been shown to correlate with lower academic performance, such as 
          reading and math scores, as well as behavioral problems such as anxiety and aggression. Finally, there is a cycle of disadvantages where poor educational achievements due to food
          insecurity result in reduced potential employment, economic productivity, and health outcomes, contributing to a cycle of poverty. </p>

        <h2>Effects On Seniors</h2>
        <p>Seniors who are facing food insecurity are at higher risk for chronic conditions and poor health as well. These conditions include diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension.
          According to the Nebraska Legislature, seniors are 2.3 times more likely to report poor health and face an increased risk of falls, the leading cause of injury in older adults. Worst of all,
          these seniors typically have higher healthcare expenses, approximately 11% more annually, due to issues managing these chronic conditions. 
        </p>

        <h2>Community Impacts</h2>
        <p>Overall, food insecurity contributes to chronic disease, mental health problems, and economic strain within communities. Diseases such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, 
          and chronic kidney disease are more common due to poor eating habits established in food deserts. In addition to this, higher rates of depression make it difficult for individuals 
          to manage their overall health and follow medical recommendations. According to the Nebraska Legislature, an estimated $114,880,000 more is needed every year to meet the food
          needs of those in Nebraska alone. Rural communities in Nebraska face challenges due to fewer grocery stores and little access to meal programs, and Madison County has just one
          summer meal site compared to nearly 80 in urban Douglas County, according to Food Bank for the Heartland. To institute change, we need to start allocating our resources better and
          focus on areas with higher levels of food scarcity. So what can we do?

        <h2>Policy and Solutions</h2>
        <p>While it may seem all bad, government bodies, officials, and even you can start to take action. 
          The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is currently the largest government-sponsored food assistance program, 
          and officials are looking into ways to improve access and increase benefits to provide better food security. 
          There have also been enhanced participation rates in programs like the School Breakfast Program (SBP) that promote awareness 
          and provide free or reduced-price meals. Expanding initiatives like SNAP, SBP, and summer meal programs are critical in
          the fight against food scarcity. Of course, there are also general improvements that can be made, such as state and local policy, enhanced economic opportunities, 
          building awareness, and improving access in rural areas to name a few. According to mySidewalk.com, other strategies may include zoning changes for 
          farmers' markets, mobile healthy food vending, and increased nutrition education. Policymakers may consider subsidizing healthy foods while taxing 
          unhealthy foods and changing food stamp programs to make fresh produce more affordable.
          Finally, supporting local charitable food systems helps to support individuals who may not qualify for federal assistance 
          and address the increased demand for charitable food resources. </p>

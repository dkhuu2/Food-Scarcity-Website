      <p><strong>Title:</strong> The Nebraska Sandhills Food Desert: Causes, Identification, and Actions towards a Resolution</p>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Andrew Thierolf</p>
      <p><strong>Published:</strong> May 2012</p>
      <p><strong>Database:</strong> UNL Academic Search Premier</p>
      <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://digitalcommons-unl-edu.libproxy.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&context=arch_crp_theses" target="_blank">View Article</a></p>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Living in a food desert means that people do not have easy access to healthy and affordable food. This leads to higher rates of health problems such 
        as obesity and diabetes. Low-income and elderly people are often hit the hardest since they often cannot travel far or afford better options. As a result, they rely on fast 
        food or corner stores, both of which do not have many healthy options. Fixing this problem will need different solutions to help these communities get access to better food. 
        Nebraska's Sandhills is a great example of where this issue is made worse by a shrinking population and the loss of grocery stores. Government action will need to be taken to 
        ensure that people have access to healthy food, and state-level programs/legislation will be key to solving Nebraska's food desert problem.</p>
      <p><strong>How It Helps:</strong> This article highlights how food deserts affect rural Nebraska, especially elderly and low-income families. It also provides effective solutions
        and insights from other states, showing how they have implemented certain policy. I used the suggested course of action presented in the thesis while also combining it with 
        other sources to get the reasoning for the proposed solution on the website. I was also able to gather information from the Sandhills area and see the negative impacts of 
        food scarcity on rural regions.  </p>

      <p><strong>Title:</strong> Food Deserts in Nebraska: A revised methodology and analysis</p>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Gregory J. McKee, PhD-Economics and Shawn C. Kaskie, PhD Candidate-Human Sciences: Leadership</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The research analysis on food deserts in Nebraska was an effective way to show how different factors impact food scarcity throughout Nebraska regions. It
        talks about how the USDA defines food deserts based on accessibility and affordability. After adjusting this definition to include rural Nebraska's spending habits and potential,
        it concludes that many counties will continue to experience food deserts through 2028. Different contributing factors include population, age, education, and spending potential. The 
        main takeaway was that farmers' markets, which are great short-term solutions, and combined efforts to manage store ownership may work as an effective locally driven solution. 
        Increasing awareness of store ownership transitions, especially within the community, may help to provide a long-term solution. </p>
      <p><strong>How It Helps:</strong> This article had a series of different maps corresponding to food scarcity in Nebraska which I was able to use throughout my website. What stood out 
        was that the maps had different factors such as education, poverty levels, and even unemployment rates which showed at least some relationship with food scarcity. I was able to 
        use some of the statistics throughout my website which had some shock value to them. The maps in the article were also used on my website to give users a more interactive experience. </p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article walks through common questions about food insecurity and its significance as a public policy issue. It goes through the definition, importance,
        specific statistics in Nebraska, impacts, and solutions. The issue affects millions of people in the United States annually and is linked to poverty, education, and housing. Food scarcity
        negatively impacts both mental and physical health, increasing the chances of developing chronic disease, associated with higher healthcare costs. Seniors and children are typically the 
        most vulnerable and rural areas and typically hit the hardest by food deserts. Though, Federal programs like SNAP and local food banks exist to provide support to those in need. </p>
      <p><strong>How It Helps:</strong> This article highlights frequently asked questions and even specific Nebraska-related statistics that were helpful when researching the topic. The easy-to-digest 
        answers and questions were referenced quite frequently and many of the statistics I used throughout the website were based on the article. Not to mention the many pictures that were
        used to help keep my website engaging. The diagrams were very well made and added another layer of information to what I already had on my website. The information on the different food
        relief programs was also helpful when gathering information for a solution on my website. </p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The report highlights food insecurity in Omaha, showing that a disproportionate amount of low-income households and communities of color are affected by 
        food scarcity. This leaves populations stuck in food deserts, which contributes to chronic health issues such as high blood pressure and diabetes. Despite SNAP benefits being available
        many households in poverty do not receive these benefits, which just further increases the issue. Overall, solutions include policy action, increased education on nutrition, and subsidies
        for healthy foods. </p>
      <p><strong>How It Helps:</strong> This article provided insight into food scarcity within Omaha, Nebraska, and effective solutions that I used when developing solutions for food scarcity 
        on my website. Things like expanding SNAP and streamlining the process to connect the general public to these benefits were great ideas and inspired me when trying to figure
        out something effective on my own. It also had generic pictures that I was able to implement throughout my website to keep users engaged. </p>

      <p><strong>Title:</strong> Why food insecurity is felt more keenly in rural areas </p>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Food Bank for the Heartland </p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Food insecurity in Nebraska, especially in rural areas, has increased since 2017, surpassing the national average. Although schools and nonprofits are preparing
        to provide meals for the summer, rural counties see fewer resources like this compared to their urban counterparts. These programs also still feeling the impact of reduced pandemic-era funding,
        but programs like the USDA's Summer Food Service and EBT cards are available to help. Resources are available and play a critical role when addressing child hunger across Nebraska but in 
        the end, it is up to advocacy and volunteer-driven initiatives to not let these opportunities go to waste. </p>
      <p><strong>How It Helps:</strong> I was able to use this website to find information on how food scarcity affects rural communities in Nebraska and use this information on my impacts page.
        The statistics that showed some neglect towards rural communities when it came to food assistance programs were powerful and helped to increase the emotional appeal of my website. It
        also helped to drive the point home that food scarcity is a very real issue affecting many people very close to us. </p>

      <p><strong>Title:</strong> Food Waste in America: Facts and Statistics </p>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Ryan Cooper, Director of Circular Economy Solutions </p>
      <p><strong>Published:</strong> July 2023 </p>
      <p><strong>Database:</strong> Google</p>
      <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.rubicon.com/blog/food-waste-facts/" target="_blank">View Website</a></p>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Food waste in America is a growing problem with millions of tons of of food being wasted every year, a large portion of the food supply. The causes of this issue include
        things such as overproduction, unrealistic aesthetic standards for produce, over purchasing, and a disregard for food in general, which leads to foods rotting in landfills. This rotting food also produces
        a significant amount of greenhouse gases contributing to global warming. With millions of U.S. citizens lacking reliable and easy access to fresh and healthy food, collective efforts must be made institue change.
        Things like portion control, better planning, and awareness of food waste are a great first step in fighting against food scarcity and food waste. </p>
      <p><strong>How It Helps:</strong> I used the statistics on this website to build my food waste calculator. Facts such as how much a family of four wastes per year, percentages of produce lost
        during production, the amount of produce lost at the consumer level, and how much food one person wastes per day, just to name a few. The statistics would be used as constants in my code and everything would then be calculated based on those constants, 
        either multiplied by days, weeks, or months all depending on the constant. These facts also helped to create good questions for the calculator form that were not too direct and would hopefully produce surprising results for users, allowing them to 
        reflect on their habits. I was also able to use these statistics on my home page as an interesting facts section so that users could see the absurd amount of food waste produced both in the United States and in the world. </p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A collection of food assistance resources in Lincoln Nebraska. </p>
      <p><strong>How It Helps:</strong> I used this website when gathering different food assistance resources in Lincoln. After going through the different resources, and gathering the ones that
        either I personally knew or had heard good things about, I implemented a similar resource section on my website for users to interact with. Doing this, I was hoping for users to be able 
        to explore the different resources in Lincoln on their own and possibly get them to be more involved. </p>

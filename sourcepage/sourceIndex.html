      <p><strong>Title:</strong> The Nebraska Sandhills Food Desert: Causes, Identification, and Actions towards a Resolution</p>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Andrew Thierolf</p>
      <p><strong>Published:</strong> May 2012</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Living in a food desert means that people do not have easy access to healthy and affordable food. This leads to higher rates of health problems such 
        as obesity and diabetes. Low-income and elderly people are often hit the hardest since they often cannot travel far or afford better options. As a result, they rely on fast 
        food or corner stores, both of which do not have many healthy options. Fixing this problem will need different solutions to help these communities get access to better food. 
        Nebraska's Sandhills is a great example of where this issue is made worse by a shrinking population and the loss of grocery stores. Government action will need to be taken to 
        ensure that people have access to healthy food, and state-level programs/legislation will be key to solving Nebraska's food desert problem.</p>
      <p><strong>How It Helps:</strong> This article highlights how food deserts affect rural Nebraska, especially elderly and low-income families. It also provides effective solutions
        and insights from other states, showing how they have implemented certain policy. I used the suggested course of action presented in the thesis while also combining it with 
        other sources to get the reasoning for the proposed solution on the website. I was also able to gather information from the Sandhills area and see the negative impacts of 
        food scarcity on rural regions.  </p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The research analysis on food deserts in Nebraska was an effective way to show how different factors impact food scarcity throughout Nebraska regions. It
        talks about how the USDA defines food deserts based on accessibility and affordability. After adjusting this definition to include rural Nebraska's spending habits and potential,
        it concludes that many counties will continue to experience food deserts through 2028. Different contributing factors include population, age, education, and spending potential. The 
        main takeaway was that farmers' markets, which are great short-term solutions, and combined efforts to manage store ownership may work as an effective locally driven solution. 
        Increasing awareness of store ownership transitions, especially within the community, may help to provide a long-term solution. </p>
      <p><strong>How It Helps:</strong> This article had a series of different maps corresponding to food scarcity in Nebraska which I was able to use throughout my website. What stood out 
        was that the maps had different factors such as education, poverty levels, and even unemployment rates which showed at least some relationship with food scarcity. I was able to 
        use some of the statistics throughout my website which had some shock value to them. The maps in the article were also used on my website to give users a more interactive experience. </p>

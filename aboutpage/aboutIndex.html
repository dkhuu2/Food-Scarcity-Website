        <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          After creating this food scarcity website, I feel that this has been a changing experience for me. Through creating this website, I have learned a lot of surprising facts
          that helped put this problem into perspective for me. Although I thought I knew a lot about the issue of food scarcity, especially in Nebraska, digging deeper into 
          my research showed me that there was so much more than I had initially thought.  
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, I knew from previous classes how widespread this issue was in the U.S., and specifically Nebraska, but what I found seemed to be worse than I remember. I found that 
          so many families in my area struggle to access enough food every day and millions of pounds of perfectly good food gets wasted every single year. It made me pause and think about 
          my habits, especially how much food I waste without even realizing it. Typically I would think of myself as a relatively resourceful person, but I never really took the time
          to sit down and put numbers on how much I waste. Using my food waste calculator, I ended up finding that the food waste my family and I produced was much more than I expected.
        </p>
          
        <p>After seeing those numbers, combined with the stories of people affected by hunger during my research, put everything into perspective. Food waste is not as simple as it seems
          and it involves other factors such as distribution, access, and affordability. But that does not mean that all I got out of this project was a whole bunch of negative feelings!
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This project has inspired me to do more than just learn about the issue. I want to do what I can to help. I have always cared about food insecurity, and although the issue 
          has never affected me, this experience has made the problem of food scarcity feel much more personal and urgent. I am looking to get back into volunteering at my local food bank
          again because I feel like I can make a difference, even if my difference is very small. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking into the future, this project has also made me want to think more carefully about the choices I make when it comes to buying and consuming food. I feel obligated to change
          my bad habits, buying only what I need and finding ways to reduce waste at home. Being that I have a garden at home, I would like to also start composting my food scraps as well! 
          It just feels good to know that I can use my time and energy to help support my community and I am reminded of the fact that there is always more to learn and more ways to help. In the end,
          although creating this website was initially just a project for another class, throughout this experience, I have had a chance to reflect, grow, and take steps toward being 
          apart of the solution moving forward.

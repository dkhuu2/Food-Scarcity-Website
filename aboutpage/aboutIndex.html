      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Creating a food scarcity website has been an eye-opening experience that taught me a lot about the issue of food insecurity. 
        I already knew food scarcity was a problem, but digging deeper into the research showed me there was so much more to it than I initially thought. 
        For example, I had some understanding of how widespread food insecurity is, but the statistics I found were shocking—like how many families 
        in my area struggle to access enough food every day or how much perfectly good food gets wasted in the process. It really made me pause and think 
        about my own habits, especially how much food I waste without even realizing it. Seeing those numbers alongside stories of people affected by hunger 
        put everything into perspective. It made me realize how complex and interconnected the issue is, involving not just food production but also distribution, 
        affordability, and access.
      <p>This project has inspired me to do more than just learn about the issue—I want to help. I’ve always cared about food insecurity, but this 
        experience has made it feel much more personal and urgent. I’m now considering volunteering at a local food bank or pantry again because I 
        feel like I can make a difference, even if it’s small. Beyond that, it’s also made me think more carefully about the choices I make, like 
        buying only what I need and finding ways to reduce waste at home. It feels good to know I can use my time and energy to support people 
        in need, but it’s also a reminder that there’s always more to learn and more ways to help. Creating this website wasn’t just a technical 
        project; it was a chance to grow, reflect, and take steps toward being part of the solution moving forward.</p>

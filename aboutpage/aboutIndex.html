        <p>Creating a food scarcity website has been a really eye-opening experience that taught me a lot about the issue of food insecurity, especially in Nebraska. 
          I already knew food scarcity was a problem, but digging deeper into the research showed me there was so much more to it than I had initially thought.</p>
          
          <p>For example, I had some understanding of how widespread food insecurity is in the United States, but the statistics I found were shocking. For example, how many families 
          in my area struggle to access enough food every day or how much perfectly good food gets wasted every single year. It really made me pause and think 
          about my own habits, especially how much food I waste without even realizing it. I like to think of myself as a relatively resourceful person but I never took the time 
          to sit down and really reflect on how much I waste. using my own food waste calculator, I found that the food waste I produce ended up being much more than I expected.</p>
          
          <p>Seeing those numbers alongside stories of people affected by hunger put everything into perspective. It made me realize how complex and 
          interconnected the issue is, involving not just food production but also distribution, affordability, and access.</p>
          
          <p>This project has inspired me to do more than just learn about the issue. I want to help. I've always cared about food insecurity, but this 
          experience has made it feel much more personal and urgent. I am now considering volunteering at a local food bank or pantry again because I 
          feel like I can make a difference, even if it is small.</p>
          
          <p>Beyond that, it has also made me think more carefully about the choices I make, like buying only what I need and finding ways to reduce waste at home. 
          It feels good to know I can use my time and energy to support people in need, but it's also a reminder that there is always more to learn and more ways to help. 
          In the end, creating this website wasn't just a technical project, it was a chance to grow, reflect, and take steps toward being part of the solution moving forward.</p>

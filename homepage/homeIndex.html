      <h1>Not So Fun Facts</h1>
      <p class="intro-text">After gathering some statistics from a few different sources, here is what I found regarding interesting facts related to food waste. A lot of these may surprise you and bring to attention the sheer amount of food waste we produce every single year.</p>
      <ol class="fact-list">
        <li>In 2018, the U.S. wasted 103 million tons of food, which is enough to match the weight of 450,000 Statue of Liberties. As if the weight of one Statue of Liberty wasn't enough to make you shocked.</li>
        <li>Worldwide, about 1.3 billion tons of food gets tossed every year, which is a third of all the food we make for people. Can you imagine how much resources are wasted in making that food?</li>
        <li>Food waste is behind 8% of all the greenhouse gases causing global warming. People really need to start paying attention to all this waste!</li>
        <li>If food waste were its own country, it would pollute more than every nation except the U.S. and China. It is unfortunate to see how much we pollute our own planet.</li>
        <li>Every year, Americans throw away 30-40% of their food supply, worth around $161 billion. $161 billion! Do you know how much Wing Stop I could buy with that?</li>
        <li>A typical family of four in America wastes about $1,500 in food annually. Imagine saving that money instead! I could really use that for Christmas gifts right now.</li>
        <li>Food waste takes up more space in U.S. landfills than anything else, making up almost a quarter of all trash. We could compost this food instead and more sustainably nourish our crops.</li>
        <li>Rotting food in landfills releases methane gas, which is way worse for the planet than car emissions. Methane gas is the same chemical that comes out of cow farts.</li>
        <li>Only a tiny bit—6.3%—of food waste in the U.S. was composted in 2017. The rest mostly ended up in landfills. Again, we could compost a lot of this waste but we choose not to!</li>
        <li>After Thanksgiving, Americans toss out about 204 million pounds of perfectly good turkey meat. I could use 204 million pounds of turkey meat in my mouth right now.</li>

      <h1>What Can You Do?</h1>
      <p> Below is a list of food assistance and food distribution resources in Lincoln that you may consider donating to. Click through to explore some of their websites if applicable.
        Some resources do not have a website. Attached are their names, what they provided, and their contact informtion.
        I have personally volunteered at a couple of these places myself in the past and I would highly recommend giving it a shot if you are willing and able to.</p>
